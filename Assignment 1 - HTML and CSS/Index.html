        <h1>Spell Shaper Notes</h1>
        <p>“Spell Shaper” is the tentative name of a roguelike magic RPG designed by Chris Arme. In the game, the player can “shape” spells
            and set them into a fixed number of spell slots. The spells are shaped by adding collected modifiers to a base spell (e.g. fireball)
            to create a new (and possibly broken) spell. Spell Shaper is designed to be intentionally unbalanced.
            Should the player craft a spell that is not useful, a spell that is overpowered, or a spell that is hilarious and game breaking, that is
            expected and <i>encouraged</i>.</p>
