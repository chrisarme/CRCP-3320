        <h1>Spell Shaper NPC Concepts</h1>
        <p>The NPCs in “Spell Shaper”, friendly and hostile, play a pivotal role. Hostile enemies are necessary for the player to test their spells against. Enemies range from weak nuisances to large, difficult bosses. The spawning location and rate of these enemies should be mostly random. Certain tile sets may have static enemies, such as mini-bosses. Friendly NPCs primarily serve as a way for the player to obtain more spells and modifiers. While these NPCs will not engage in combat, they can converse with the player should they be prompted. NPCs can reveal information about the world of Spell Shaper, both lore-wise and gameplay-wise.</p>

        <h2>Hostile NPCs</h2>
        <p>Enemy NPCs will have different types and styles. How the player chooses to deal with these different styles of enemies is not defined. For example, one player may choose to defeat a melee enemy with long ranged spell barrage, while another player might defeat the same enemy with a passive, poison-based approach.</p>
        <p>Some examples of enemies might include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Melee:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Dog/Wolf</b> - A fast moving canine with low health</li>
                <li><b>Goblin Swordsman</b> - A weak goblin with moderate melee range, movement, and health</li>
                <li><b>Heavy Soldier</b> - A slow moving, aggressive enemy wielding a large great sword</li>
                <li><b>Dark Wraith</b> - A terrifying dark spirit that can slip between realms</li>
                <li><b>Shield</b> - A large enemy equipped with only a massive shield</li>
            </ul>

            <li><h3>Ranged:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Crystal Kid</b> - A small living crystal that shoots crystals out of itself, but dies to nearly any attack</li>
                <li><b>Adept Mage</b> - A mage that attacks with a multitude of spells from afar, but has little mobility</li>
                <li><b>Goblin Chucker</b> - A weak goblin that throws vials that debuff those hit</li>
                <li><b>Vampyre</b> - An agile undead that attacks with blood and, given the chance, can drain blood</li>
                <li><b>Elemental Mage</b> - A dangerous mage with exclusive training in a specific elemental type</li>
            </ul>

            <li><h3>Bosses:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Goliath</b> - A massive, but slow moving, monster with destuctive unarmed attacks</li>
                <li><b>Master Mage</b> - A mage with incredible knowledge of spells and uses them zealously</li>
                <li><b>Ý̢̳͙̦̻v̴̢͎̗̘̗̼̦͇͉̮̘̙͓͎̘̟̬̤̩̀j̧̧͖̲̯͟͞i̴̡͝͏͇͖̘̮͔̟͈̼͓ļ̭̮̫̪͇̩̫̮͡-̶̷̭̲̜̘͚́͠Ģ̵̨̞̗͈̰̻̖͈̠ͅr̨̡̛͏̪̞̜̰̮̰͈̫͔̭̘͝t͞͏̤̯͙̫̯̘̱̩̫̼͘ḩ̡̖͙̠̠̼͍̲̤̟̻̞̳̜͇͖̳t҉̵̻̼̺̖̫͓̺̬͘͢ȩ̷̴̲̫̱͈̤͍͈͠͞/</b> - T̨̛̛̟̞͔͔͔̘͙͓̹H͢҉͔̮̦̯E̡̺̼̙̟̹̙͔̕ ̵̢͈͙̰̹̜̹̭̫͎̫̹̪͕͖̬̥̹̩̮̀͜͠E̡̯̰̬̲̗̻̦̟̲̻̭̠͓̩͓̫̙͢N̶̷̶̲͔̺̖̬̟̭̠̙͟͞ͅD̷̶̵͕̜̖̪̣̮͕̠̯͔͙͖<li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Friendly NPCs</h2>
        <p>Though friendly NPCs are primarily designed to give the player spells and modifiers, the requirements for them to be given differ per NPC, tentatively known as “quests”. NPCs may have randomized quests with randomized rewards. However, some specific NPCs may have static quests, rewards, and/or locations. For example, there may be a tutorial NPC that always asks the player to kill a “Goblin Swordsman” and always rewards the player with a “Fireball” spell.</p>
