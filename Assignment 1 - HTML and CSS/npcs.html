        <h1>Spell Shaper NPC Concepts</h1>
        <p>The NPCs in “Spell Shaper”, friendly and hostile, play a pivotal role. Hostile enemies are necessary for the player to test their spells against. Enemies range from weak nuisances to large, difficult bosses. The spawning location and rate of these enemies should be mostly random. Certain tile sets may have static enemies, such as mini-bosses. Friendly NPCs primarily serve as a way for the player to obtain more spells and modifiers. While these NPCs will not engage in combat, they can converse with the player should they be prompted. NPCs can reveal information about the world of Spell Shaper, both lore-wise and gameplay-wise.</p>
