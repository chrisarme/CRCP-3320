        <h1>Spell Shaper NPC Concepts</h1>
        <p>The NPCs in “Spell Shaper”, friendly and hostile, play a pivotal role. Hostile enemies are necessary for the player to test their spells against. Enemies range from weak nuisances to large, difficult bosses. The spawning location and rate of these enemies should be mostly random. Certain tile sets may have static enemies, such as mini-bosses. Friendly NPCs primarily serve as a way for the player to obtain more spells and modifiers. While these NPCs will not engage in combat, they can converse with the player should they be prompted. NPCs can reveal information about the world of Spell Shaper, both lore-wise and gameplay-wise.</p>

        <h2>Hostile NPCs</h2>
        <p>Enemy NPCs will have different types and styles. How the player chooses to deal with these different styles of enemies is not defined. For example, one player may choose to defeat a melee enemy with long ranged spell barrage, while another player might defeat the same enemy with a passive, poison-based approach.</p>
        <p>Some types of enemies might include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Melee:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dog/Wolf - A fast moving canine with low health</li>
                <li>Goblin Swordsman - A weak goblin with moderate melee range, movement, and health</li>
                <li>Heavy Soldier - A slow moving, aggressive enemy wielding a large great sword</li>
                <li>Dark Wraith - A terrifying dark spirit that can slip between realms</li>
                <li>Shield - A large enemy equipped with only a massive shield</li>
            </ul>
